{Short description of the web site to be evaluated and what should
come out of the evaluation.}
The website that will be evaluated is the website of a pharmacy in Graz. People visit this website to
buy medicine, health products and care products. Furthermore they can inform themselves about several 
services the pharmacy provides. It is important that the website will be evaluated because people need 
to have an easy and well-built webpage when they have concerns about their health.
</p>
</section> -->

The website that will be evaluated is the website of a pharmacy at the main train station in Graz. It provides an overview of all the services and also includes an online<br/>
shop. Additionally the website also provides the user with news about the pharmacy and general ways to improve health.<br/>

<p>
Heuristic evaluation is a process which experts utilize to determine the usability of a user interface by conducting independent walkthroughs and by reporting issues that came up during the walkthroughs. The insights gathered by the evaluators are used to enhance the usability of the user interface of a product, e.g., a website. In 1990 two pioneers in web usability, Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Milch, published an article containing a set of heuristics. This set contains ten heuristics which a system should contain. 
Firstly the user should be informed appropriately and promptly about the status. Secondly the system should display information in a way that the user is able to understand it. Additionally, it should offer control and make it able for the user to undo errors. The system should also be consistent so the users are not confused and can get familiar with the UI. Errors should also be prevented and if the user wants to engage in risky behaviour, the user should warned beforehand. Information and instructions should be visible so the users do not have to rely on their memory. The UI should also be flexible so experienced users are able to achieve their goals faster. Furthermore, only the most relevant information should be visible to prevent cluttering, which might overwhelm the user. Next, if a error occurs or the user needs help the language should be simple so that the user finds a solution as fast as possible. Finally, the documentation should be easy to find and should also include concise steps for overcoming problems.
Even though heuristic evaluation is an extremely powerful tool to enhance the usability of a system, it is so substitute for usability testing. At the end the evaluation is subjective, and the evaluators are influenced by biases which might distort the results.<br/>
[<a href="#IDF">IDF</a>]

<!-- <p>
Heuristic evaluation is ...
Heuristic Evaluation is an often used way to evaluate user interfaces. Thereby a bunch of evaluators 
look at the interface and note down noticeable problems and positive findings. In order to do this 
process they have to use certain guidelines. Advantages of this method are the cheapness oft the 
execution, the easiness to motivate people to do it, the early usage in the development process and the 
fact that there is no advance planning required. Experiments demonstrated that individual evaluaters 
only found between 20 and 51 percent of the usability problems. For this reason there should be several
persons (preferably 5 to 8) who evaluate the interface [Nie1990]. 
</p<>

<p>
  In contrast to the advantages there are also some downsides of Heuristic Evaluation. One disadvantage 
  is that the user’s opinion isn’t involved. Second, it can be difficult to find experts that do the 
  evaluation in-house. Therefore the company might has to hire external experts who can be expensive. 
  Third, some aspects might be described as a problem although it is not an issue for the users 
  [<a href="#ref-Elma2022">Elma2022</a>].
</p>

<p>
These are the steps to conduct a Heuristic Evaluation:<br/>
1.	Plan the evaluation: The tasks that are important for the site should be identified and tested. It is
    essential that there are no difficulties for the users to perform these. The evaluators should also 
    know the goals of the system. 
2.	Choose the evaluators: The best are experienced evaluators. One expert finds about 81 to 90 percent 
    of the usability problems. One evaluator without experience finds about 22 to 29 percent of the 
    problems.
3.	Look at the Heuristics: There are several guidlines that can be used.
4.	Conduct the evaluation: You can do it as an individual evaluation where each evaluator reviews the 
    interface on his own, or you can do it as a group evaluation where the interface is reviewed in a team. 
5.	Analyse the results: When the conduction is finished the information has to be compiled. Duplicates 
    have to be removed and similar issues have to be combined [<a href="#ref-Danino2001">Danino2001</a>]. 


... by Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich in 1990
[<a href="#ref-Nie1990">Nie1990</a>].
</p> -->

<p>
For this evaluation, the "Andrews General Usability Heuristics", shown
in Appendix <a href="#appsecHeuristics">A.1</a>, will be used. These are
based on and slightly adapted from Nielsen's revised set of ten
usability heuristics [<a href="#ref-Nie1994a">Nie1994a</a>].

<!-- <p class="instructions">
{Describe the kinds of user the site is trying to attract.}
The site is trying to attract users in multiple ways. First of all, with an huge inventory 
of medicine, it tryies to sell products online. They also mention articles of fitness tips on 
the site.

<p class="instructions">
People who visit this website have health issues. Therefore they want to buy medicine or they want
to get some consultation about a specific kind of therapy. Some of the people do also want to do a
Covid-19 test. There are also people who want to buy cosmetics. 
  {Describe the kinds of user the site is trying to attract.}
</p>

<p class="instructions">
{Group these users into categories according to their
characteristics.}
1) people that want to improve there overall health conditions
2) people who are sick and need medication
3) people that want to order medicine online
4) people that seek tips, on how to improve there health
</p>

<p class="instructions">
{Describe the goals and typical tasks for each of these
user groups.}
</p> -->

<p>
  Because this website includes an online pharmacy store and also shares information about the pharmacy, the biggest target demographic will be tech savvy people which prefer to buy their medications and other health products online. Additionally, there might a small group of people which can not get out of the house and have to order the things online. If the person is not particularly tech savvy, they might encounter problems. 
1) they want to life a more balanced and healty life, they will be reading tips on products to do <source>
2) they want to get the medicine that there doctors gave them, they will more likely only get the medicine
and go 
3) this group could have some physical obstacle to go get medicine, therefor just order it online
4) they are seeking to be close to nature, therefor read tips on how to improve life with plant based 
"medicine" and purchase them

<p>
  <!-- Katharina -->
  Katharina will use LosslessCut 3.53.0 on Windows 10
  to extract the video clips from her screen recordings.

  <!-- Marco -->
  Marco will be capturing the Videos in OBS Studio 29.0.2-2 on Arch linux. Then transfer the created videos
  per extern HDD to his PC with Windows 10 and cut them in LosslessCut 3.53.0.  

  <!-- Rolando -->
  Since the iPhone 13 Pro has a native resolution smaller than
  FullHD, the video clips will be copied over to a Windows PC where Marco will
  upscale it to 1920×1080.
  
  <!-- Vanessa -->
  Vanessa and Rolando will use a lightning cable to transfer the screen recording to their 
  laptop. They will then use QuickTime Player in order to extract, cut and edit
  the video clips.
