<blockquote>
<p>
Hi, my name is Harald. I'll be working with you in today's session.
[Frank and Thomas here will be assisting]. 
We are here to test a web site and would like your help.
</p>

<p>
I will ask you to perform some typical tasks with the web site. Do your
best, but don't be overly concerned with results - the system is being
tested, and not your performance. Since the system is not perfect,
there will probably be some rough edges and bugs and things may not
work exactly as you expect.
</p>

<p>
[I am an independent researcher hired to conduct this study, and have
no affiliation with the system whatsoever]. My only role here today is
to discover the flaws and advantages of this system from your
perspective. Don't act or say things based on what you think I might
want to see or hear, I need to know what you really think.
</p>

<p>
So that we can better follow your trail of thoughts during the test,
we will ask you to think aloud while you work. Please do ask
questions at any time, but I may only answer them at the end of the
session.
</p>

<p>
While you are working, I will be taking some notes. We will also be
recording the session for the benefit of people who couldn't be here
today.
</p>


<p>
If you feel uncomfortable, you may stop the test at any time.
</p>

<p>
Do you have any questions?
</p>

<p>
If not, then let's begin by filling out a short background
questionnaire and having you sign the consent form.
</p>
