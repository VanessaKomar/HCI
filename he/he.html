          <p>
            The website that will be evaluated is that of a pharmacy at the main
            train station in Graz. It provides an overview of all the services and also
            includes an online store. Additionally the website also provides the user with
            news about the pharmacy and general ways to improve health. It is important that
            the website will be evaluated because people need to have an easy and well-
            built webpage when they have concerns about their health.

          <section id="subsecEvaluationMethodology" aria-labelledby="subsecEvaluationMethodologyHeading">
            <h3 id="subsecEvaluationMethodologyHeading">3.1 Evaluation Methodology</h3>

            <p>
              The heuristic evaluation is a process which experts utilize to determine the
              usability of a user interface by conducting independent walkthroughs and by
              reporting issues that came up. The insights gathered by the evaluators are
              then used to enhance the usability of the user interface of a product, e.g., a
              website.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 1990 two pioneers in web usability, Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Milch,
              published an article containing a set of heuristics. This article outlines the ten heuristics
              which a system should include in order to provide the best experience for the user.
              These heuristics include concepts such as informing users regarding the website's status,
              employing consistency throughout the site, error prevention, and information
              visibility to name a few [<a href="#ref-IDFn.d.">IDFn.d.</a>].
            </p>

            <p>
              For our heuristic evaluation we will be using a revised version of Nielsen's
              usability heuristics called the "Andrews General Usability Heuristics", as shown in
              Appendix <a href="#appsecHeuristicsHeading">A.1</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Below are the steps we will follow to in order to conduct a Heuristic Evaluation as mentioned in [<a
                href="#ref-Nie1994">Nie1994</a>]:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Plan the evaluation: Determine the site that should be tested as well its specific functionality.
                Include the heuristics that the evaluators will be using while performing a walkthrough of the site.
              </li>
              <li>
                Conduct the evaluation: These evalutations should be done individually by a group of 5-8 participants.
                Each
                individual will review the website while keeping the heuristics in mind,
                in order to determine both negative and positive findings.
              </li>
              <li>
                Analyse the results: When the evaluation is finished the information that the individual evaluations
                produced
                will be combined and sorted by the evaluators, as a group, based on the severity of the findings.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Even though heuristic evaluation is an extremely powerful tool to enhance the usability of a system, when
              not done by experts, it is no substitute for usability testing [<a href="#ref-And2023">And2023</a>]. In
              the
              end, the evaluation is subjective, and the evaluators are influenced by biases which might distort the
              results.

          <section id="subsecUserProfiles" aria-labelledby="subsecUserProfilesHeading">
            <h3 id="subsecUserProfilesHeading">3.2 User Profiles</h3>

            <p>
              As this website is an online pharmacy which includes an online store as well as general information
              regarding the pharmacy, the
              biggest target demographic will be tech savvy people who prefer to buy their medications and other
              health products online. Additionally, there could be a small group of users who are unable to leave the
              house and have to order things online. If this person is not particularly tech savvy, they might
              encounter problems while attempting to order their medications.
            </p>

            <p>
              This allows us to group users into the following categories:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                People who want to live a more balanced and healty lifestyle
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    These people would go onto the website and read up on the general fitness tips under the News
                    section.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                People who want to pick up their prescriptions
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    After finding the nearest pharmacy and being guided to this site, the person would then go to the
                    location and pick up their medication.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                People who have some hinderance that makes it difficult to go to the pharmacy in person
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    These people are able to navigate to the shop section of the website and order their medication to
                    be
                    delivered.
                  </li>

              </li>
              <li>
                People who are seeking alternative/natural treatments
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    These people would be able to look on the website to see which herbal and homeopathic remedies are
                    availbe in stores.
                  </li>

              Vanessa and Rolando will use a lightning cable to transfer the screen recording to their

              the video clips.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since the iPhone 13 Pro has a native resolution smaller than
              FullHD, the video clips will be copied over to a Windows PC where Marco will
              upscale it to 1920×1080 using LosslessCut 3.53.0.

                When the user arrives at the home page, they are greeted with a gaudy
                animted image containing some seemingly random content, as shown in
                Figure <a href="#figure-X">X</a>. It is extremely distracting and
                irritating.
              </p>

              <p>
                The screen real estate in the middle of the home page is the most
                valuable on a web site. It could be used in a much more productive
                way, say to highlight some particularly important news or success
                stories.
