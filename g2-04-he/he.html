          <h2 id="secExecutiveSummaryHeading">1 Executive Summary</h2>

          <p>
            This report contains the heuristic evaluation for <a href="https://bahnhof-apo.at/">bahnhof-apo.at</a>. As
            previously mentioned, and as specified
            in section <a href="#subsecEvaluationMethodologyHeading">3.1 Evaluation Methodology</a>, each
            evaluator conducted an individual heuristic evaluation of the
            website. These evaluations were conducted on a variety of devices and browsers to ensure that a thorough
            evaluation of the website is done. The findings were documented in log files along with short videos which
            helped to display the findings. The results of these separate evaluations were combined and the findings
            were rated and ranked based on severity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The five most prevalent issues that were found during the heuristic evaluation are outlined below.
            There are some links throughout the website which do not work correctly and lead to a 404 page. When on the
            homepage and clicking "go to shop" on the "Hyaluron Tagescreme", the website displays an error with the
            message that the site couldn't be found.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many parts of the website where the user is unable to navigate to without going back to the home
            page. The navigation to logically move from one page to another is also missing on many pages. For example,
            there is an offer section where products are listed with discounts, but when the user clicks on one such
            offer, there is just a short description but no link or button to add the product to the cart.
            There are different navigation bars for different parts of the website. For example the homepage and the
            shop navigation bars differ. The sidebar menu for this site changes depending on the page that the user is
            on. This leads to the user having difficulties navigating through the website and being frustrated because
            they are unable to quickly find the page that they want.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the website there are buttons and pop-ups that block information. For example the "Frage zum
            Produkt"-button blocks parts of the product description. This can lead to the user being frusturated because
            they are unable to see some important text.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a lot of different inconsistencies throughout the website in terms of design. This includes the
            bottom section, slide arrows, Angebote, naming differs throughout website, on the form, the name doesn't
            have "*" to show is required. While these are all small separate issues, these inconsistencies are a common
            occurrence throughout the website and therefore need to be addressed
            There were also a lot of positive aspects of the website that deserve to be mentioned. The top three
            positive aspects are described below.
          </p>
          <p>
            The availability of a product is already shown before the user even enters the specific product page. It is
            practical that you can immediately see if the product is available.
            It is good that the row with the important links is fixed. Therefore you don't need to scroll up everytime
            you want to change the section.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Website provides the user with information when the pharmacy has opened and where to find nearby
            pharmacies. It is super helpful for people who really need a pharmacy.
          </p>

        <section id="secIntroduction" aria-labelledby="secIntroductionHeading">
          <h2 id="secIntroductionHeading">2 Introduction</h2>

          <p>
            The website that will be evaluated is that of a pharmacy at the main
            train station in Graz. It provides an overview of all the services and also
            includes an online store. Additionally the website also provides the user with
            news about the pharmacy and general ways to improve health. It is important that
            the website will be evaluated because people need to have an easy and well-
            built webpage when they have concerns about their health.

        <section id="secEvaluationProcedure" aria-labelledby="secEvaluationProcedureHeading">
          <h2 id="secEvaluationProcedureHeading">3 Evaluation Procedure</h2>

          <p>
            This section describes the procedure used in the heuristic evaluation.
          </p>



          <section id="subsecEvaluationMethodology" aria-labelledby="subsecEvaluationMethodologyHeading">
            <h3 id="subsecEvaluationMethodologyHeading">3.1 Evaluation Methodology</h3>

            <p>
              The heuristic evaluation is a process which experts utilize to determine the
              usability of a user interface by conducting independent walkthroughs and by
              reporting issues that came up. The insights gathered by the evaluators are
              then used to enhance the usability of the user interface of a product, e.g., a
              website.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 1990 two pioneers in web usability, Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Milch,
              published an article containing a set of heuristics. This article outlines the ten heuristics
              which a system should include in order to provide the best experience for the user.
              These heuristics include concepts such as informing users regarding the website's status,
              employing consistency throughout the site, error prevention, and information
              visibility to name a few [<a href="#ref-IDFn.d.">IDFn.d.</a>].
            </p>

            <p>
              For our heuristic evaluation we will be using a revised version of Nielsen's
              usability heuristics called the "Andrews General Usability Heuristics", as shown in
              Appendix <a href="#appsecHeuristicsHeading">A.1</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Below are the steps we will follow to in order to conduct a Heuristic Evaluation as mentioned in [<a
                href="#ref-Nie1994">Nie1994</a>]:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Plan the evaluation: Determine the site that should be tested as well its specific functionality.
                Include the heuristics that the evaluators will be using while performing a walkthrough of the site.
              </li>
              <li>
                Conduct the evaluation: These evalutations should be done individually by a group of 5-8 participants.
                Each
                individual will review the website while keeping the heuristics in mind,
                in order to determine both negative and positive findings.
              </li>
              <li>
                Analyse the results: When the evaluation is finished the information that the individual evaluations
                produced
                will be combined and sorted by the evaluators, as a group, based on the severity of the findings.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Even though heuristic evaluation is an extremely powerful tool to enhance the usability of a system, when
              not done by experts, it is no substitute for usability testing [<a href="#ref-And2023">And2023</a>]. In
              the
              end, the evaluation is subjective, and the evaluators are influenced by biases which might distort the
              results.

          <section id="subsecUserProfiles" aria-labelledby="subsecUserProfilesHeading">
            <h3 id="subsecUserProfilesHeading">3.2 User Profiles</h3>

            <p>
              As this website is an online pharmacy which includes an online store as well as general information
              regarding the pharmacy, the
              biggest target demographic will be tech savvy people who prefer to buy their medications and other
              health products online. Additionally, there could be a small group of users who are unable to leave the
              house and have to order things online. If this person is not particularly tech savvy, they might
              encounter problems while attempting to order their medications.
            </p>

            <p>
              This allows us to group users into the following categories:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                People who want to live a more balanced and healty lifestyle
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    These people would go onto the website and read up on the general fitness tips under the News
                    section.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                People who want to pick up their prescriptions
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    After finding the nearest pharmacy and being guided to this site, the person would then go to the
                    location and pick up their medication.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                People who have some hinderance that makes it difficult to go to the pharmacy in person
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    These people are able to navigate to the shop section of the website and order their medication to
                    be
                    delivered.
                  </li>

              </li>
              <li>
                People who are seeking alternative/natural treatments
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    These people would be able to look on the website to see which herbal and homeopathic remedies are
                    availbe in stores.

              laptop. They then used QuickTime Player in order to extract, cut and edit
              the video clips.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since the iPhone 13 Pro has a native resolution smaller than
              FullHD, the video clips were copied over to a Windows PC where Marco
              upscaled it to 1920×1080 using LosslessCut 3.53.0.

                There are some links throughout the website which do not work correctly and leads to a 404 page. When on
                the homepage and clicking "go to shop" on the "Hyaluron Tagescreme", the website displays an error with
                the message that the site couldn't be found, as shown in Figure <a href="#figure-4">4</a>.
              </p>

              <p>It is important to ensure that all the links on the website work. Therefore
                it is necessary to check that all links on the website are up to date. It is
                good however that the website has a custom 404 page.

              <p>
                The website is difficult to navigate. There are many parts of the website where
                the user is unable to navigate to without going back to the home page.
                The navigation to logically move from one page to another is also missing on many pages.
                For example, there is an offer section where products are listed with discounts, but when the user
                clicks on one such offer, there is just a short description but no link or button to add the product to
                the cart, as shown in Figure <a href="#figure-6">6</a>.
              </p>

              <p>Navigation is an important part of the having a good experience for users. It is therefore
                important to make sure the navigation is intuitive and that you are always able to navigate
                well from one page to the next.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are different navigation bars for different parts of the website. For example the homepage and the
                shop navigation bars differ. The sidebar menu for this site changes depending on the page that the user
                is on, as shown in
                Figure <a href="#figure-7">7</a>. This leads to the user having difficulties navigating through the
                website and being frusturated because they are unable to quickly find the page that they want.
              </p>

              <p>It is important to keep consistency throughout the website and therefore the have
                the navigation bar be the same no matter what page you are on.

              <p>
                Throughout the website there are buttons and pop-ups that block information.
                For example the "Frage zum
                Produkt"-button blocks parts of the product description, as shown in
                Figure <a href="#figure-8">8</a>. This can lead to the user being frusturated
                because they are unable to see some important text.
              </p>

              <p>It is therefore necessary to ensure that there is no text or information being
                covered throughout the website.

                the bottom section, slide arrows, Angebote, naming differs throughout website, on the form, the name
                doesn't have "*" to show is required. One such example is shown in
                Figure <a href="#figure-9">9</a>. While these are all small separate issues, these inconsistencies
                are a common occurance throughout the website and therefore need to be addressed
              </p>

              <p>Small error throughout the website can really stand out and it is necessary to pay
                more attention to these issues throughout the website in order to fix them.
